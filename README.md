# UnderstandingTypeScript
This project contains code I wrote while following the [Understanding TypeScript - 2022 Edition](https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-typescript/) course by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.

### Description
The __UnderstandingTypeScript__ project is written using `TypeScript`.\
Each exercise can be run by selecting the full path to the relevant `index.html`
file and pasting into a browser. You can then interrogate the code in the `app.js` file via 
`Developer Tools`.
