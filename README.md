# UnderstandingTypeScript
This project contains code I wrote while following the [Understanding TypeScript - 2022 Edition](https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-typescript/) course by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.

### Description
The __UnderstandingTypeScript__ project is written using `TypeScript`.\
Each exercise can be run by selecting the full path to the relevant `index.html`
file and pasting into a browser. You can then interrogate the code in the `app.js` file via 
`Developer Tools`.

To see the affect of code changes immediately in the browser we use `lite-server`, which is run via `npm start`.
`lite-server` is a simple _development only_ server which serves a web app (from the `index.html` file in the 
root directory) on the URL `localhost:3000`. It refreshes when HTML or JavaScript changes are made.
